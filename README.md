**Introduction:**

The Secure Messenger application is an innovative Android platform engineered to ensure the highest standards of secure text-based communication. Rooted in the XMPP protocol, the app prioritizes device-to-device secure communication through the OMEMO standard encryption. The project, developed primarily in Kotlin, incorporates cutting-edge Android development practices, including advanced features like Kotlin Coroutines and multithreading services. The application follows the Clean Architecture design pattern for superior stability and maintainability.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **Android SDK:** Native Android SDKs
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture
- **UI/UX:** Android Jetpack Compose
- **Concurrency:** Kotlin Coroutines, Multithreading services
- **Database:** SQLite for local data storage
- **Data Encryption:** Local data encryption for SQLite DB and DataStores
- **Server:** Custom XMPP server deployed with Prosody

**Key Features:**

*Authentication:*
- Users can log in with existing UUID and password or register with a new UUID.
- The passcode feature adds an extra layer of device security.

*Contact Management:*
- Two-way subscription is required for secure communication.
- Users must add each other to contacts before initiating conversations.

*Message Exchange:*
- OMEMO encryption ensures fully encrypted text messages.
- Only the recipient's device can decrypt the messages.

*Device Security:*
- Passcode protection against unauthorized device access.
- Passcode set-up is mandatory post-login for added security.
- Incorrect passcode entry three times triggers data wipe.

*Logout and Data Security:*
- Users can log out from the profile page.
- Logging out removes all local user data from the device.

*Local Data Encryption:*
- Utilizes local data encryption for SQLite DB and DataStores for comprehensive security.

**Implementation Details:**

*XMPP Server Integration:*

The implementation of a custom XMPP server using Prosody was a pivotal aspect of the project. Prosody, renowned for its scalability and extensibility, was selected to seamlessly integrate with the Android application. The server was configured to handle user authentication, message routing, and OMEMO encryption key management. Extensive testing and optimization were performed to ensure the server's reliability and responsiveness.

*Clean Architecture Design:*

Clean Architecture, as the chosen design pattern, played a crucial role in organizing the codebase. The separation of concerns into distinct layers—presentation, domain, and data—ensured a modular and maintainable code structure. This facilitated easier testing, reusability, and the ability to adapt to future changes without compromising system stability.

*Android Jetpack Compose for UI/UX:*

Android Jetpack Compose was employed for building the user interface, providing a modern and declarative UI development experience. The adoption of Compose allowed for concise UI code, efficient state management, and simplified UI testing. The resulting UI is both visually appealing and user-friendly, aligning with the latest design principles.

*Concurrency Management with Kotlin Coroutines:*

Kotlin Coroutines were utilized to manage asynchronous tasks, enhancing the application's responsiveness and resource utilization. Coroutines simplified complex asynchronous operations, such as network requests and encryption processes. The adoption of structured concurrency ensured better control and organization of concurrent tasks, contributing to the overall efficiency of the application.

*Multithreading Services:*

To further optimize performance, multithreading services were implemented to handle parallel execution of tasks. Leveraging Kotlin's native support for multithreading, critical operations, such as data synchronization and background tasks, were distributed across multiple threads. This resulted in improved responsiveness and reduced the likelihood of UI freezes.

*Security Measures - Local Data Encryption:*

The application prioritizes data security by implementing local data encryption for both SQLite databases and DataStores. This ensures that sensitive user information stored locally is safeguarded against unauthorized access. The encryption mechanism adds an additional layer of protection, aligning with industry best practices for securing user data.
